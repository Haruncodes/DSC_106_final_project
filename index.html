<!-- <p><b>Write Up</b></p>
  <p> First Question: What have you done so far? 
  <p>
    On Thursday, we decided to pivot away from our initial decision to use the
    mice dataset in favor for a more intriguing dataset concerning student cognitive 
    performance during exams. On Friday, we started re-brainstorming on our new dataset 
    to see how we can make an interesting visualization that achieves a good mix of
    story-telling and curiosity, which ultimately landed on gamifying our project by 
    making a quiz for users to select an average Heart Rate and Temperature during 
    an exam type of their choice (midterm or final). The idea is that this quiz will
    be used to select the student that closely fits the user’s quiz selections, which
    we will then use to display all of his/her statistics (HR, temp, etc.) in interesting 
    visualizations that comes after the quiz. Then, throughout the long weekend, we 
    worked on the D3 Code to build our first prototype, focusing on making the quiz 
    and first visualization of a line chart of average heart rate and temperature.
  </p>
  <p> Second Question: What will be the most challenging of your project to design and why?  </p>
  <p>The most challenging part of our project would be data wrangling and visual design of our project. We would like to win the best project award, and to do this, we’ve decided to choose a dataset that we believe can provide a lot of information that we can display, an advantage that our new dataset possesses. But, to display this in an intriguing manner, our project (described above) will have to deal with a lot of data merges and cleaning to combine all students in one big dataframe, which proved to be challenging as not all students started their exams at the same time (and other student specific problems too like missing data). In addition to that, visual design will be a big thing in our project as we aim to have a seamless and clean design as users scroll down throughout our visualizations; without this, we believe, our project will become confusing and less interesting in general.   </p> -->
